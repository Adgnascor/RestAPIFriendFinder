# <u>Finished with all issues?</u> 

Yes, we finished all our issues. In this sprint we didn't have as many issues as we did in previous sprints, but the issues were a lot bigger and we managed to finish all of the issues just a few minutes before we closed it. 

# <u>**If not, why?**</u>



# **<u>Issues, not done:</u>**
