# **Sprint 4 Review** 

**Secretary: Samuel** **B**

## <u>Finished with all issues?</u> 

No we did not manage to complete all issues. 

## <u>**If not, why?**</u>

We simply did not have enough time for these. And since they were on low priority it was not that great of a failure for us. Maybe with better coordination and communication we might have been able to finish them in time.

## **<u>Issues, not done:</u>**

[FGC-91](https://sebastianjones.atlassian.net/browse/FGC-91)

[FGC-123](https://sebastianjones.atlassian.net/browse/FGC-123)

[FGC-109](https://sebastianjones.atlassian.net/browse/FGC-109)

( [FGC-95](https://sebastianjones.atlassian.net/browse/FGC-95) )

( [FGC-96](https://sebastianjones.atlassian.net/browse/FGC-96) )

The issues in parenthesis were technically done but not set to done in Jira.

## **<u>What can we do better in next sprint?</u>**

- We can try to improve communication and organization. 
- We'll try to estimate issue-time better and complete all of the issues in the sprint.
- We can be better/quicker about asking for help. 



## **<u>Is there anything we need to add to the backlog?</u>**

- Add more Links for HATEOAS
- Testing all the request again to make sure that they work
- Look into more about Swagger
- Review all the requests
- Get more understanding about HATEOAS
