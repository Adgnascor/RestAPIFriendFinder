# <u>Finished with all issues?</u> 

No, we didn't finish one of the issues, but all of the other issues were completed. 

# <u>**If not, why?**</u>

The reason as to why we didn't finished this issue is mainly because we didn't prioritize it. It had a low priority level and we felt like other issues needed to be done before we could focus on this. We also added this issue into the sprint after a few days, when we needed to add more which meant that we didn't plan for it from the beginning and only started working on it when we had some time over. 

# **<u>Issues, not done:</u>**



- Set up Test environment - [FGC-6](https://sebastianjones.atlassian.net/browse/FGC-6)
  - New time estimate? - No need, the current estimate is good. 
  - Some parts done? - Yes, the most basic things that we need for this issue is done and its currently implemented in its own branch. 
  - What do we need to finish next time? We need to work more on it and make sure that its ready to be merged into Master. 

# **<u>What can we do better in next sprint?</u>**

- Document more clearly in the stand up by adding the issue ID when we decide who is gonna work with what. 



# **<u>Is there anything we need to add to the backlog?</u>**
