# <u>Finished with all issues?</u> 

No, we had one issue left. As stated further down, the issue that wasnt finished is about populating the database with testdata and we added it so that we can see if the database and its relationships works as intended and so that we can start testing our request in postman properly. 

# <u>**If not, why?**</u>

The reason why we didn't finish this issue is because we encountered problems with the "User" table and the "City" table and we did not know how to fix these problems.  There seems to be some problem with the relationship between these 2 tables, but we will need more time on this issue before we can say exactly what the problem was. 

# **<u>Issues, not done:</u>**

- [Populate the database with testdata FGC-141](https://sebastianjones.atlassian.net/browse/FGC-141)

# **<u>What can we do better in next sprint?</u>**

- Work on more "Specific issues", make the issues less general and add more information in the description. Also be more thorough when creating the issues. 

# **<u>Is there anything we need to add to the backlog?</u>**

- Work on DTO - Specify more on the already existing issue with more information and subtasks.
- Controllers - Revamp the existing POST,DELETE,PUT-requests to work with the general repository
- Work with HATEOAS - Create subtasks for each request that need links and which links they should have. 
- Controllers - Keep on adding more request for the different controllers. Discuss what requests should be made and create subtasks for each request. 
- Clean up the backlog - Go through the backlog and make sure that completed issues are marked as completed and that there are no duplicates.
